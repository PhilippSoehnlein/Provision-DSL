Changes for Provision::DSL

0.14    2013-03-26
        * updated documentation
        * added Platform::Unix as dependency to explicitly inhibit an
          installation on the forbidden OS
        * changed name for the .provision_... dir to contain host and user
          for keeping distinct directories for individual host/user pairs
        * changed ssh commandline to Net::OpenSSH
        * executed Entities directly at runtime instead of maintaining a list
          to prevent Inspectors from failing too early
        * colorized output of provision run for easier status overview
        * refactored script to multiple Provision::DSL::Local::* classes

        2012-12-12
        * improved restart conditions for Service-Processes under Linux
        * unified clearer/predicate definitions "=> 1" instead of names
        * check if config file returns a hashref, die otherwise

0.13    2012-11-13
        * removed an issue caused by mis-behaved rsync. If 'abc/def' is
          excluded, then 'abc' was reported to get deleted which made no sense
          and caused rsync to periodically fire.
        * removed PERL_CPANM_OPT settings for remote machine

        2012-11-10
        * added docs
        * cleanup Rsync: remove backup
        * Script::Provision cleanup: remove 'Files' keyword
        * made empty provision file handling more tolerant

0.12    2012-11-07
        * introduced File::Zglob for traversal thru directories for
          giving Inspectors simpler parameters an deep file traversal
        * changed the way Inspectors are instantiated
        * Added a base class for inspectors with deep file traversal
        * corrected tests to reflect changes

0.11    2012-11-06
        * added logging to a file inside a log directory if given on the
          commandline.
        * enabling file logging as a default
        * recursive transfer of every log directory content onto the local
          machine after provision.

0.10    2012-11-05
        * simplified the structure of the .provision_XXX directory on the
          local side. Maintaining an identical directory on the remote side.
          Planning to rsync log entries back to local.

0.09    2012-11-04
        * changed the way how inspectors and installers can get used
          in a provision script.
        * updated all tests to match this changed behavior
        * fixed forgotten changes to perl-5.8 compatibility

0.08    2012-11-03
        * removed all absolute paths to executable binaries to be more
          independant from the *nix flavour
        * changed all perl-5.10 specific operations to re-enable things
          when only perl-5.8 is available.

0.07    2012-11-01 (launch date of 007 "skyfall")
        * added "append_if_missing" option to file patch
        * added more examples
        * allowed absolute paths in config file for collecting resources
        * added a modification of "/etc/sudoers" file if current user
          is not mentioned inside this file. Requires a password at
          first login.
        * user, hostname and provision script can get entered as
          commandline options and will override config settings if present.

0.06    2012-10-28
        * changed .tar packing to fetching from a local rsync daemon
          resources, remote script and libraries are copied via rsync
          when needed
        * most hard coded executable paths are constants
        * many things are configurable
        * configuration format separated in local/remote part for clarity
        * long ssh command line instead of piped script
        * 'include' directive allows separating a provision script into parts
        * syntax check of provision script before remote execution
        * fixed many tests, some still missing.

0.05    2012-08-31
        * app is a singleton
        * added inspectors and installers as optional components

0.04    2012-08-10
        * improved state calculation by eliminating method modifiers
          and using only entities with children
        * factored out many things into roles

0.03    2012-07-23
        * moo work is complete
        * provisioning scripts are executable

0.02    2012-07-11
        * switched to Moo for getting less dependencies

0.01    2012-07-08
        * initial proof-of-concept using Moose for simplicity
