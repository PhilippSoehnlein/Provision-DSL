TODO for provisioning
---------------------

1) DSL: depending on context (scalar/void)
     * put an entity on a TODO list in source order (void)
     * retrieve an entity from a cache-list (scalar)
       ensure we evaluate late in order not to create an entity!!!

2) Entity:
     * add "listen" and "tell" --> rearrange order
     * priority (= source order)
       Sort-Key = priority
     * execute_before (= affect ordering)
       if exists: Sort-Key = (execute_before-1 . priority)

3) Tests:
     * isolate tests from DSL -- no Capital() constructors!
     * testing with Resources is OK

4) Execute:
     * cwd attribute


Idea. 'listen' attribute. 
    if a previously defined entity has changed, the listening entity
    is changed also
     

Idea. add functionality: -- bad.

Provision::DSL::Execution
    * maintain execution order

Provision::DSL::Execution::Step
    * link to an Entity
    * store priority, execute_before
    * calculate sort_key
